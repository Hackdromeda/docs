# Rules and Expectations

## Rules

### General Overview

Inadequate contribution, abandonment of role task\(s\) without notice, harassment, code tampering, discovery of malicious intent, unauthorized activities including but not limited to code deletion, false claims, lack of communication or collaboration, and/or deception will result in removal from the project and potentially the group. The founding members reserve the right to remove any member for any reason including the reasons above without notice or warning for the benefit of the rest of the group. These requirements are subject to change and can change at any time without prior notice.

**You must: be able to communicate via voice and text with your teams, know how to use the languages and tools required, be willing to learn new languages, use the required software, and follow the rules above.** Once this project moves to maintenance, you may need to maintain certain portions of the codebase from time to time.

We use collaboration tools such as Google Calendar, Glo, GitHub Issues and Project Boards, and Visual Studio Live Code. **You must be able to notify your team leads if you are unable to meet deadlines, respond to notifications for a period of time, and/or attend a remote meeting.** If a notice is not provided, you are subject to removal from the group in accordance with a more detailed version of these rules that will be sent to you.

Donations: Donations from external contributors will be distributed to persons continuing the maintenance of the project and bearing any production-related costs.

### Minimum Expectations

**You are expected to complete EVERY assignment that is specifically assigned to you.** It is your responsibility to request help or a deadline extension for a **valid reason**. 

You are also expected to contribute to your team and help others with any other problems the may have.

**You must attend all meetings**, mostly remote such as via Discord unless you notify us in advance.

**You must be responsive to any notifications**, primarily through GitHub Issues and our Discord Server.

**If you fail to meet any of these minimum requirements, you will be warned and a strike may be issued.** If you are unable to meet a deadline, complete a task, or join a meeting because of a change in schedule, it is your responsibility to notify your team leader. Using the change-in-schedule excuse several times to avoid doing work is not acceptable.

**These are just the minimums. Exceeding these minimums will not only benefit the team and the project, but** _**you**_ **as well.**

### Strikes

We are using a five \(5\) strike system to ensure that all Hackdromeda members are committed to the team. Strike one will not result in any action. Strike two will result in a discussion about your schedule with a team lead. Strike three will result in being suspended or banned from participating in Hackdromeda projects for a provided period of time. Strike four will be a permanent ban from participating in Hackdromeda projects and removal from any current projects. Strike five will result in being banned from the Hackdromeda team indefinitely.

**One strike wears off two weeks after your last strike was issued**. You have to wait the same amount of time for additional strikes to wear off. **If you are found abusing any policies, your removal from the group may be expedited.** All policies are subject to the discretion of the team leads.
