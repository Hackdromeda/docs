Let us know about any errors you see

Our code is made for running on a AWS Lambda function. If you comment out the opening and closing bracket for the export function, you should be able to run the code locally. You may need to use hardcoded inputs and console.log\(\) to fully test for a desired response rather than to only test if the code is syntactically correct.
